# [Building Outreach Tool](https://maxwell-austensen.shinyapps.io/building-outreach-tool)

This app is designed to help NYC housing organizers identify and prioritize nearby properties for outreach.

**This project is currently in active development!**


* The basic idea of the tool is that you can input your own address, the number of nearby buildings you want to find, and the number of minutes walk from home to look within, and get a map of the buildings to prioritize for outreach along with relevent details about the properties.  
* Then on the map you'll see a black dot appear for your address, and red dots for the nearby buildings that are the "highest priority" for outreach. This priority is based on things like the number of violations with the city, past evictions, deregulated units, etc. 
* On the right side of the page you'll also see some more detailed information about each building. At the top is your home building, and below are all the ones you'll be considering for outreach.  
* From each row of the tables you can link out to some other existing tools (DAP Portal and Who-Owns-What) for more information about the building.  
* Along the rows there is information about the number of units/violations/complaints/evictions etc, the apartment numbers where complaints have been made, and other information.  
* At the beginning of each row there is a button that will take you to a new page on the tool where you can find more details about some of the numbers. Right now the example is for complaints to the housing department - you can see every open complaint since 2019 and more details about each one. Later we can expand this to include all the other information such as evictions, violations, etc.

The tool was developed for the [Ridgewood Tenants Union](http://ridgewoodtenantsunion.org/) by the [Housing Data Coaltion](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/) as a project of its [Data Help Desk](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/#data-help-desk).

This app is built on top of the critical work done by [@aepyornis](https://github.com/aepyornis), and other members of the [Housing Data Coalition](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/), on the [NYC-DB](https://github.com/nycdb/nycdb) project.



## About the Housing Data Coalition

The [Housing Data Coalition (HDC)](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/) is a group of individuals and organizations who collaborate on the use of public data to further housing justice in New York City. In the face of the real estate industryâ€™s escalating exploitation of housing data to drive speculation and displacement, HDC seeks to make public data more accessible and actionable for housing justice groups. Through a structure of working groups and monthly meetings, HDC provides opportunities for members to connect, learn, and give mutual support to a variety of projects involving housing data.
