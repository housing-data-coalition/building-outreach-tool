The tool was developed for the [Ridgewood Tenants Union](http://ridgewoodtenantsunion.org/) by the [Housing Data Coaltion](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/) as a project of its [Data Help Desk](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/#data-help-desk).

This app is built on top of the critical work done by [@aepyornis](https://github.com/aepyornis), and other members of the [Housing Data Coalition](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/), on the [NYC-DB](https://github.com/nycdb/nycdb) project.

**This project is currently in active development!**


## About the Housing Data Coalition

The [Housing Data Coalition (HDC)](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/) is a group of individuals and organizations who collaborate on the use of public data to further housing justice in New York City. In the face of the real estate industryâ€™s escalating exploitation of housing data to drive speculation and displacement, HDC seeks to make public data more accessible and actionable for housing justice groups. Through a structure of working groups and monthly meetings, HDC provides opportunities for members to connect, learn, and give mutual support to a variety of projects involving housing data.
